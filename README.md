## Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I'm Amar, a passionate **Computer Science student at ESI-Alger** with a deep love for *Desktop Programing** and an ever-growing curiosity for **graphics programing** and **AI**. i learned some stuff about **win32 api** when trying to learn **directx11** but it was too messy so i went to **opengl** :) 

### 🔭 Past projects:
-> **rust game** with **bevy** and **tauri**,wasm and nextjs
-> tauri + Nextjs desktop **file manager** for **ESI TRESOR**,
-> **almost done with clonning medium.com** worked on front with **NextJs**,tiptap (stopped currently for studies and interest in graphics programing, but i will come back in vacation inchallah)

### 🔭 What I'm working on:
I’m currently following an **OpenGL** course and started reading a graphics programing fundamentals book.

### 🌱 What I'm learning:
I'm expanding my skill set in:
- **Graphics programing** – for understanding how gpu rendering workings and because math & geometry !!
- **OpenGL\C++** – opengl is an api for rendering stuff with gpu !!

### 👯 Future plans:
- **ML** diving deep to do a model that involved moving 3d objects in my own opengl renderer.
- **AI** understanding ai in game dev using unreal engine
- **WGPU** a modern alternative to opengl using rust !! (same api as Webgpu) so learning it will give me ability to do graphics on web with big performance



### 📫 How to reach me:
You can reach me at [ma_hassam@esi.dz](mailto:ma_hassam@esi.dz). Or hit me up via GitHub, I’m always open for a conversation!

### 😄 Pronouns: 
He/Him

### ⚡ Fun fact:
Did you know? Sometimes diving into more complex topics can provide a valuable perspective that makes simpler concepts more understandable and enjoyable !!
-> it hapenned to me when trying to learn some win32 api + directx11 and realizing how opengl is simple and fun!!
