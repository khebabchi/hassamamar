### Hey there! its *Hassam Amar* aka *Khebabchi*

I'm Amar, a passionate **Computer Science student at ESI-Alger** with a deep love for *Desktop Programing** and an ever-growing curiosity for **graphics programing** and **AI**. i learned some stuff about **win32 api** when trying to learn **directx11** but it was too messy so i went to **opengl** :) 

### ðŸ”­ Past projects:
-> **rust game** with **bevy** and **tauri**,wasm and nextjs
-> tauri + Nextjs desktop **file manager** for **ESI TRESOR**,
-> **almost done with clonning medium.com** worked on front with **NextJs**,tiptap (stopped currently for studies and interest in graphics programing, but i will come back in vacation inchallah)

### ðŸ”­ What I'm working on:
Iâ€™m currently following an **WebGPU** course and started reading a graphics programing fundamentals book.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm learning:
I'm expanding my skill set in:
- **Graphics programing** â€“ for understanding how gpu rendering workings and because math & geometry !!
- **WebGPU\Rust** â€“ webgpu is an api for rendering

### ðŸ‘¯ Future plans:
- **ML** diving deep to do a model that involved moving 3d objects in my own opengl renderer.
- **AI** understanding ai in game dev using unreal engine

### âš¡ Fun fact:
Did you know? Sometimes diving into more complex topics can provide a valuable perspective that makes simpler concepts more understandable and enjoyable !!
-> it hapenned to me when trying to learn some win32 api + directx11 and realizing how opengl is simple and fun!!
